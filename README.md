What?
In this project we creater a server from scratch, then we connected router function to the server which routes us to the corresponding handler.
On the client side we implemented an autocomplete feature and our database is states.json

Why?
-To make an autocomplete function
-Seperate between the server and the client sides

How?
Simple start typing a name and the search bar will autocomplete the name for you.
Then hit the search button.

Challenges:
-To remove the double-click bug ; when selecting an item from the list, we need to click twice to make disappear
solution : we used the event.key attribute to undersatnd the diffrence between clicking on the list or type using the keyboard
-understanding he connections between the files

<!-- Any more challenges? -->

Features:
Autocomplete: start typing and options will appear. Then left click the desired option.
Case-sensitivity: All name searches are case-insensitive.

 <!-- Any more cool features?  -->

Technologies: Javascript,HTML,CSS,Node-JS
